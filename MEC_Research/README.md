# Mobile Edge Computing Resource Allocation Optimization 

This project is a part of my master's thesis, to study the research challenges in allocating mobile edge computing resources in 5G wireless networks. To address, the resource allocation problem I developed and implemented an auction theory-based resource allocation algorithm. 

The resource allocation algorithm is designed based on the MEC resource orchestration system architecture for the 5G wireless communication systems.
